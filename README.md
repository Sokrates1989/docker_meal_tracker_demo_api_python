# Docker Meal Tracker API Demo (Python)

This API serves as a **demonstration** for user authentication and meal tracking functionalities, designed for **evaluation purposes only**. It allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on meals using Docker for containerized deployment. This demo is not intended for production use and is provided under an **Evaluation License**.

## Project Overview

This demo API provides basic functionality for meal tracking, including user authentication and meal management. Built using FastAPI and MySQL, it supports operations such as registering users, logging in, and managing meal data (adding, editing, deleting meals). The project leverages Docker for seamless deployment in both local and production environments.

This project is designed **for evaluation purposes only** and should not be used in a production environment.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Register and log in users with token-based authentication.
- **Meal Tracking:** Add, edit, and delete meals.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker Compose for local development and Docker Swarm for production deployment.

## Initial Setup

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local environment:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/api/directory/meal-tracker-api-python
cd /path/to/api/directory/meal-tracker-api-python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meal-tracker-api-python.git .
```

### Setting Up Configuration

After cloning, copy the template configuration files to the appropriate locations:

```bash
cp config.txt.template config.txt
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit these files to configure your environment variables:

- **config.txt:** Configure your database settings, encryption keys, and other API-related settings.
- **.env:** Set up sensitive environment variables like database credentials and API tokens.

---

## Local Deployment for Development

### Building with Docker Compose

To deploy the API locally for development and testing, use Docker Compose to build and run the container:

```bash
docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up
```

Make sure that the `.env` and `config.txt` files are correctly configured before running the command. This setup is recommended for local development only.

---

## Production Deployment

For production, we recommend building the Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying the service using Docker Swarm.

### Building the Docker Image

Build the Docker image locally using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t yourdockerhubusername/meal-tracker-api-python:latest .
```

### Pushing to Docker Hub

Once the image is built, push it to your Docker Hub repository:

```bash
docker push yourdockerhubusername/meal-tracker-api-python:latest
```

### Deploying with Docker Swarm

To deploy the API on a Docker Swarm cluster, pull the image from Docker Hub and create a service:

```bash
docker service create --name meal-tracker-api-python --replicas 3 --publish 8080:8080 yourdockerhubusername/meal-tracker-api-python:latest
```

Ensure that your `.env` and configuration files are properly set up before deploying the service in production.

## Documentation

### Viewing Documentation Online

An online version of the project's internal developer documentation can be found at:

### Generating API Documentation

To generate the project's documentation locally, follow these steps:

#### Activate Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment if you haven't already:

```bash
python -m venv venv_meal_tracker_demo_api_python
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```bash
  .\venv_meal_tracker_demo_api_python\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  source venv_meal_tracker_demo_api_python/bin/activate
  ```

#### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies from the `pip_install.txt` file, and then install pdoc3:

```bash
pip install -r docker/pip_install.txt
pip install pdoc3
```

#### Generate Documentation

To generate the documentation:

```bash
pdoc --html --output-dir docs ./src ./main_api_startpoint.py
```

The documentation will be generated in the `docs/` folder. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the documentation.

#### Manual Integration of README.md

1. **Locate the Generated HTML File:**  
After running the `pdoc3` command, the `index.html` file will be created inside the `docs` folder.

2. **Convert README.md to HTML:**  
Convert the `README.md` to HTML using Pythonâ€™s markdown package:

   ```bash
   pip install markdown
   ```

   Run this Python script:

   ```python
   import markdown

   with open("README.md", "r") as md_file:
       readme_content = md_file.read()

   html_content = markdown.markdown(readme_content)

   with open("readme.html", "w") as html_file:
       html_file.write(html_content)
   ```

3. **Insert the Converted HTML:**  
Manually copy the HTML content from `readme.html` and paste it into the `docs/index.html` file.

4. **Style the Inserted Content:**  
Use CSS in the `docs/_static` directory to style the README content if necessary.
